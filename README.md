# Tales of Brevis: A Beast Called God

Tales of Brevis is a local two-player asymmetric multiplayer game where one player collects carrots while the other tries to stop them. Get it from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/tales-of-brevis-a-beast-called-god/9ns8g9qgfqqp).

This repository only includes the scripts for the game, since the purpose is to show my contributions as a programmer. The other assets, such as art, audio, and Unity-specific files, are in a private repo.

The scripts are organized into several folders:

* `Camera`: Scripts related to the game camera.
* `Characters`: Scripts related to the characters controlled by the players.
* `Gameplay`: Scripts related to overall gameplay.
* `Objects`: Scripts related to the different objects in the game.
* `Other`: Scripts that don't fit into the other categories, such as scripts related to UI.
* `Utilities`: Scripts that contain common functionality used by other scripts.
